## 🌟 Features

- **AI Demonstration:** Watch how neural networks learn to navigate through obstacles.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple controls make it easy for anyone to view.
- **Visual Feedback:** View real-time results of the AI learning process.
- **Tutorials Included:** Step-by-step guides on how to use the application and understand the underlying AI concepts.

## 📖 How It Works

This application uses neural networks to simulate how AI learns the game. 

1. **Data Collection:** The AI gathers data from its gameplay, noting what works and what doesn't.
2. **Training:** The AI trains itself using this data. It uses various algorithms to improve its performance over time.
3. **Execution:** Once trained, the AI applies what it has learned, adapting as it plays.

This cycle of learning showcases the power of machine learning in a fun and interactive way.

## 🧑‍🏫 Tutorials

If you're new to AI or neural networks, don’t worry! Included within the application is a section for tutorials where you can:

- Learn about basics of neural networks.
- Understand how Flappy Bird works.
- Explore how AI models are trained.

These resources will guide you through each concept at your own pace.
